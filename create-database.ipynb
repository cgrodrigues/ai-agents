    "# CRM Database Creation Script\n",
    "This Python script creates a SQLite database named 'account_products.db', which simulates a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. The database contains three tables: accounts, products, and account_products. These tables store information about customer accounts, products, and the relationship between accounts and products, respectively. The script uses the Faker library to generate realistic sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tables and Columns\n",
    "**accounts**: This table contains information about customer accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* account_id (TEXT): A unique identifier for the account.\n",
    "* email (TEXT): The email address associated with the account.\n",
    "* telephone (TEXT): The phone number associated with the account.\n",
    "* responsible_name (TEXT): The name of the person responsible for the account.\n",
    "* address (TEXT): The address associated with the account.\n",
    "* created_date (DATE): The date when the account was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**products**: This table contains information about products.\n",
    "\n",
    "* product_id (TEXT): A unique identifier for the product.\n",
    "* product_name (TEXT): The name of the product.\n",
    "* category (TEXT): The category of the product (e.g., Cat 1, Cat 2).\n",
    "* monthly_fee (REAL): The monthly fee for the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**account_products**: This table establishes the relationship between accounts and products, indicating which products are associated with each account.\n",
    "\n",
    "* account_id (TEXT): A unique identifier for the account.\n",
    "* product_id (TEXT): A unique identifier for the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Functionality\n",
    "* generate_product_info: Generates random product information.\n",
    "* get_created_date: Generates a date between the given start date and the current month.\n",
    "* generate_account_info: Generates random account information.\n",
    "* generate_account_product_info: Generates the relationship between an account and products.\n",
    "* craete_crm_database: Creates the SQLite database with sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script initializes the Faker library to generate realistic data for accounts and products. It then creates dataframes for products and accounts, including a special account with ID \"888-8\". The script generates random relationships between accounts and products and writes this data to the SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this script, you will create a CRM database that can be used for testing and development purposes."
